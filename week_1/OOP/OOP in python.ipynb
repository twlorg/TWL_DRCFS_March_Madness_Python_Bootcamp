    "1. Self:<br>\n",
    "In OOP, the term \"self\" refers to the instance of a class that is currently being operated on. It is a reference to the object itself. When we create an object from a class, the object has its own unique properties and values, which we can access using the \"self\" keyword. In other words, \"self\" is a way for us to access the attributes and methods of an object from within the object itself.\n",

    "A method is a function that is associated with a class or an object. It represents a behavior or an action that the object can perform. In Python, methods are defined inside a class and can access the object's attributes using the \"self\" keyword. For example, if we have a Person class, we might define a method called \"speak\" that allows the person to say something.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Constructors:<br>\n",
    "A constructor is a special type of method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and values. In Python, the constructor method is called \"init\" and takes in the \"self\" parameter, as well as any other parameters that we want to use to initialize the object's attributes. For example, if we have a Person class, we might define a constructor that takes in the person's name, age, and gender and initializes those attributes for the object."

The new class, called the subclass, inherits all the attributes and methods of the existing class, called the superclass. The subclass can then add new attributes and methods, or override the existing ones, to create a new class that is more specific or specialized.\n",

    "`@classmethod` is a decorator that can be applied to a method in a class to indicate that the method is a class method. A class method is a method that belongs to a class, rather than to an instance of the class. This means that a class method can be called on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class. Class methods are often used as factory methods that create new instances of a class. To define a class method in Python, you use the `@classmethod` decorator, as shown in the example below:"

    "In this example, we define a BankAccount class that has two private attributes, \\_\\_account_number and \\_\\_balance. These attributes are not accessible directly from outside the class. Instead, we define public methods like deposit, withdraw, and get_balance that allow controlled access to these attributes. The transfer method is also defined to allow transferring funds between accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we define a private method \\_\\_update_balance that is only called internally from within the class. This method is used by the transfer method to update the balance of the destination account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define a private method \\_\\_str__ that overrides the default \\_\\_str__ method to provide a string representation of the object that includes the account number and balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using private methods and attributes in this way, we can encapsulate the internal workings of the BankAccount class and prevent external code from accessing or modifying these attributes directly. This helps to ensure the integrity of the account data and reduce the risk of errors or fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "code adds a @property decorator and a corresponding account_number method to the BankAccount class. This allows external code to access the account number attribute in a read-only fashion using the dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it also adds a @account_number.setter decorator and a corresponding __change_acc_no method. This allows external code to modify the account number attribute using the dot notation as well, but only by calling the change_acc_no method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change_acc_no method takes additional parameters banker and branch, which are intended to be logged or recorded in some way to keep track of the changes made to the account. The method also prints a message indicating the change made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a setter method to modify the account number attribute, we can perform additional checks or operations before allowing the change to happen. For example, we could check if the new account number is already in use, or we could log the change to a database for auditing purposes. This helps to ensure the integrity and security of the account data."
